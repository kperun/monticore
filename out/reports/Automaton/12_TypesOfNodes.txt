======================================== Types of Nodes (all)
#Objects  #Visits  Nonterminal-Name
========================================================== Explanation
Types of Nodes: Shows a List of all AST-Node-Types that occur in the final AST.
Types of Nodes (with Source Position): Shows the subset of all AST Node Types
which occurred in the initial AST after the parsing step.
Types of Nodes (without Source Position): Shows the subset of all AST Node Types
which have been added to the initial AST after the parsing step (e.g. by model
transformation).
For each AST type entry in the lists the following information is reported: 
 - #Objects:  number of its instances of the corresponding AST type
 - #Visits:   how often nodes of that type have been visited by a
 call/includeTemplate
